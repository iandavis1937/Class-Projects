This repository contains R files I created while learning to use R. The file entitled 'Extension_Analysis' contains the R script I used to analyze an original Qualtrics survey extending a psychological investigation of the ways racial identity salience, color-blind attitudes, social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism, and racial prejudice interact.
